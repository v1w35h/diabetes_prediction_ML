# Diabetes Prediction model for kaggle competion: 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e12

Test and training data can be found on the site above.

This is a culmination of different types of models and techniques I learned in my intro ML course at UTK. Some models included in this notebook are logistic regression, XGBoost, and MLP. You may also notice that there are Random Forest models being trained as well, but they showed too much overfitting to be used in the ensemble thus I excluded it.

Even with an Ensemble I only got model accuracies of 66-67%
